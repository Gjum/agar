[agar.io](http://agar.io/) Python client with optional GTK frontend

    python3 main.py

Requires `pip install websocket-client` module for the headless client
and GTK for the optional GUI.

Under Arch Linux, you may also want to run

    pacman -S python-gobject python-cairo pygtk

to install the GTK dependencies. Other distros should have similar packages.
